This repository contains the official implementation of our paper: **"Duth at SemEval-2024 Task 6: Comparing Pre-trained Models on Sentence Similarity Evaluation for Detecting Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes."**

We present our participation in **Task 6** of the **18th SemEval** competition, focusing on evaluating the performance of various pre-trained models for sentence similarity in the context of hallucination detection and related errors.
